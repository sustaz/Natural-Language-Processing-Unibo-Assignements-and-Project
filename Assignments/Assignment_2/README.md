# Assignment 2

In order to keep things cleaner as possible, we've split everything into two notebooks:
* [specifications.ipynb](https://link-url-here.org) the notebook provided by Galassi, Ruggeri and Torroni, containing all the specifications for the second assignment
* [assignment_2.ipynb](https://link-url-here.org) the notebook containing the actual code for our solution

### TODO:

* Dataset cleaning: the text of Claims and Evidences is very "dirty". Also, some evidences are not sentences e.g. "Absolute Taste", and some of them are duplicated (Don't know if it is strictly necessary though).
* Sentence embedding
