# Assignment 2

In order to keep things cleaner as possible, we've split everything into two notebooks:
* [specifications.ipynb](specifications.ipynb) the notebook provided by Galassi, Ruggeri and Torroni, containing all the specifications for the second assignment
* [Assignment_2.ipynb](Assignment_2.ipynb) the notebook containing the actual code for our solution
* [demos.ipynb](demos.ipynb) temporary notebook where we can play around with various stuff before implementing it into the final code and keep things cleaner in the main notebook

### TODO:

* Dataset cleaning: the text of Claims and Evidences is very "dirty". Also, some evidences are not sentences e.g. "Absolute Taste", and some of them are duplicated (Don't know if it is strictly necessary though).
* Sentence embedding: We have to implement the 4 different options proposed in [specifications.ipynb](specifications.ipynb)
* Merging inputs
* Multi-input classification
